  <thing id="puEctGr3" name="Ectoplasmic Grapnel" description="A blob of malleable, adhesive ectoplasm shoots out from your outstretched hand, attached by an ectoplasmic cord. Upon hitting its target, this ectoplasmic grapnel reels in, pulling the target to you - or you to it.\n\nWhen manifesting this power, you must have a hand free, and must make a ranged touch attack against the target; a miss causes the grapnel to retract instantly without attaching to anything. Alternately, you may have it shoot out from your shield instead of a free hand; you still get your shield&apos;s AC bonus against the target, but lose it against anyone else for the duration of the power.\n\nIf you target a creature no more than one size category larger than you, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If successful, you move the creature 5 feet closer to you. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&apos;s CMD, you can drag the target an additional 5 feet toward you. If the creature is willing, you may drag it up to 30 feet closer to you.\n\nIf you target an unattended object, you may pull it up to 30 feet towards you; if this moves it into your square, you may grasp the item immediately as a free action, although you must have a free hand to do so. If you target an attended object, the ranged touch attack is made against the opponent, and you must succeed at a disarm or steal (your choice) combat maneuver check to wrest the item free.\n\nIf you fail at the combat maneuver check (or if you target an immovable object such as a creature more than one size category larger than you, an object bolted to the floor, or a building wall, floor, or ceiling), you are instead moved up to 30 feet towards the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternately, you may choose to relinquish your grip on the ectoplasmic cord, knocking you prone and ending the power immediately rather than moving you towards the target. If you end your movement at a climbable location (such as a wall or ledge), you must attempt a Climb check (at normal DC) to grab hold (or pull yourself over the edge, in the case of a ledge); failure means you begin falling, and must make a second Climb check with +20 DC to catch yourself.\n\nIf you spend a full-round action bracing yourself before manifesting this power, you get a +2 bonus on the above combat maneuver checks. Each adjacent ally that spends an Aid Another action to grab hold of you also adds a +2 bonus to your combat maneuver check, but also suffers the consequence of being dragged or knocked prone with you should the check fail. If the power duration should be extended beyond instantaneous (see augment below), each ally holding onto you must spend an Aid Another action each turn to maintain their hold. If you end your movement at a climbable location, each ally may make a Climb check to grab the wall, or may instead continue holding onto you; your own Climb check is penalized as normal if their combined weight drops your encumbrance into a category with a worse armor check penalty.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; failure means you are no longer grappling the creature, while success means you gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple. If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are not in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; success means you have broken free of the grapple, while failure means you are still grappling (but gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple). If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly, unless the creature grappling you is too large for you to drag (in which case the cord snaps and the power fails). The grappling creature may voluntarily release you from the grapple to avoid being dragged or knocked prone, but must do so before the combat maneuver check is rolled.\n\n{b}Augment{/b}: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl. if the ranged touch attack hits. The cord does not automatically retract; you may choose to retract or extend the cord up to 30 feet (to the limit of the power&apos;s range) as a standard action, and must succeed at a combat maneuver check each time you attempt to drag an unwilling creature in this manner. Other creatures may climb or manipulate the cord as they would a rope, but it is as strong as a chain. An unwilling creature attached to the grapnel must cut (5 hp, hardness 10, AC 10) or burst (Str DC 26) the cord to move away from you, unless he succeeds at a drag combat maneuver check to pull you behind him. If the cord is cut or burst, or if you let go of the cord (a free action), the power ends immediately.\n\n2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the range of the power increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./lvl.).\n\n3. If you spend 4 additional power points, the cord retracts the full length instantly. A successful combat maneuver check, by any margin, pulls the target adjacent to you, while a failed combat maneuver check pulls you adjacent to the target (unless you relinquish the cord and go prone instead).\n\n4. For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power can drag creatures an additional size category larger than you, and the cord&apos;s hardness increases by 2, hit points increases by 10, and break DC increases by 2.\n\n5. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a move action.\n\nIn addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of these effects, you also gain a +1 bonus on any combat maneuver checks or Climb checks you make for this power." compset="PsiPower" summary="Use a ray of ectoplasm to perform a variety of functions.">

  <thing id="puTriSh0" name="Trick Shot" description="By altering the levels of probability surrounding a small object in motion, you can &#145;trick&apos; it into performing seemingly impossible maneuvers. While this ability has no direct influence on an attack roll, it can nevertheless make a certain outcome possible in the first place. Until the beginning of your next turn, you may make one Tiny or smaller moving object perform a &#145;trick shot&apos; -- a stunt that you describe -- so long as it is not moving under its own power (thrown objects or fired projectiles are not moving under their own power, while an insect or a flying psicrystal are). So long as the stunt can be succinctly described in ten words or less, it occurs, no matter how unlikely this is. This trick shot has no influence on attack or damage rolls, although the effect itself may allow an attack to occur. Example trick shots include the following (which are descriptive and of varying complexity; the sentences used in manifesting are shorter): - Shooting an arrow through the sockets of twelve axe heads between you and your target - Bouncing a billiard ball off of nine different fixtures (including your friend&apos;s breastplate) before sinking in a pocket - Having a crossbow bolt &#147;loop the loop&#148; before impacting normally - Forcing a tossed coin to land, perfectly stable, on its edge - Getting a javelin to slalom around trees between you and your target - Directing the tiny bead of an undetonated {i}fireball{/i} to fly a &#147;figure eight&#148; around its target&apos;s feet - Allowing a dagger, despite being pointy, to bounce off of the ground between a creature&apos;s legs and continue unhindered to its actual target behind him\n\nAdditional trick shots beyond this list are possible.\n\nFrom a combat perspective, the most powerful use of this power would be to shoot around corners, but doing so is treated as shooting blind. It is more frequently used, however, to show off outside of combat.\n\n{b}Augment{/b}: You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways.\n\n1.

This does not allow it to shoot through armor or walls (you still need clear line of effect to your target), but it does allow it to impact a target without the target noticing. A bolt that successfully hits a corporeal target embeds itself entirely in the target, but the effect is not obvious -- the bolt does no damage, and there&apos;s no entry wound. You may only have one active ephemeral bolt effect at any time and you must overcome any applicable Power Resistance for the delayed-delivery aspect of this power to function.\n\nAt any point during the power&apos;s duration, as a swift action, you may order the ammunition to return to the material plane, at which point it delivers its full normal damage (adjusted for damage reduction if appropriate) +1d4 points of force damage before dissipating back to its constituent ectoplasmic particles. No external wounds are present from this damage. This power is frequently used to deliver poison as well as its usual effects; such additions to the ammunition take effect when damage is dealt.\n\nAs a side property of the phasing effect, ephemeral bolts can be used to attack ethereal creatures while you stand on the material plane, although they are treated as invisible unless you can see them through other means.

The storm itself manifests as a wall which can intensify the existing winds in a small area, or can instead be set to exactly counter such winds, generating a peaceful area of calm. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls to enclose specific points.\n\nChoose to intensify or pacify the winds when you manifest this power (although the decision can be changed when you reshape the effect, see below). Intensifying the winds creates an invisible vertical curtain of wind. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Flying creatures smaller than Medium size cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Projectiles of 1 pound or less passing through the wind wall are deflected upward and miss. For every pound above 1 of the projectile&apos;s weight, it has a 10% chance to not be blown off course. Projectiles weighing 10 lbs or more are unaffected by the wind wall. Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in {i}gaseous form{/i} cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).\n\nPacifying the winds allows you to generate a region of calm that consists of every 5 ft. cube that shares an edge or space with where the wind wall would otherwise be.

  <thing id="puLocWi3" name="Localized Windstorm" description="Through force of will alone, you generate a small storm of psychokinetic turbulence in the air. The storm itself manifests as a wall which can intensify the existing winds in a small area, or can instead be set to exactly counter such winds, generating a peaceful area of calm. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls to enclose specific points.\n\nChoose to intensify or pacify the winds when you manifest this power (although the decision can be changed when you reshape the effect, see below). Intensifying the winds creates an invisible vertical curtain of wind. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Flying creatures smaller than Medium size cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Projectiles of 1 pound or less passing through the wind wall are deflected upward and miss. For every pound above 1 of the projectile&apos;s weight, it has a 10% chance to not be blown off course. Projectiles weighing 10 lbs or more are unaffected by the wind wall. Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in {i}gaseous form{/i} cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).\n\nPacifying the winds allows you to generate a region of calm that consists of every 5 ft. cube that shares an edge or space with where the wind wall would otherwise be. These regions are treated as if their wind conditions were two categories fairer than they would naturally be, to a minimum of no winds. Additionally, if these areas of calm overlap an existing wind wall or an intensifying localized windstorm, the two effects cancel, letting normal wind conditions prevail in the square.\n\nAt any point during the duration, you may extend your concentration to a full-round action.
